If no file is specified it will look for two files in the /config directory based on the name of the database being given at the command line. Therefore if the database is given as -d addresses it will look for addresses.json or addresses.js and addresses_design.json or addresses_design.js and will load those into the database\n* dump - dumps the database documents, including attachments, into a single `.json` file\n* reset - destroys the database, then recreates it and loads the seed files\n\nLooks for a file named `db_connection.json `in a `/config` directory in the root of the project which contains couchDb connection information:\n\n    {\n        \"host\": \"https://casamiento.iriscouch.com\",\n        \"port\": \"443\",\n        \"username\": \"casamiento\",\n        \"password\": \"floppsy1\"\n    }\n\nSeed files should contain an array of document objects to be imported. The default location of the seed file is `/config/seed.json`. If the file ends in `.json` it expects valid json delimited by `\"` marks. If the file ends in `.js` it will expect a file that exports an object such as an array of documents. E.g.:\n`module.exports = [{_id: \"doc1\"}, {_id: \"doc2\" }]`",
